# Mtr-mini-map-python
This project was originally created on May 2023


Used functions, control flow, file handling, various data structures, and command line processing in the project. 
You may have previously used the MTRâ€™s trip planner to navigate Hong Kong. Upon entering the origin and destination stations, the software computes various travel options, including the fastest and alternative routes. Dealing with multiple routes in a complex transit network like Hong Kong can lead to a considerable number of options, making it a computationally intensive task.

I have developed a simplified travel planner for the MTR sub-network using my acquired knowledge from ENGG1330 Computer programming 1 . For the sake of this project, it is assumed that there are at most two lines passing through an interchange station in the given sub-network.
